## Django-store-app
I created this store app to help me improve my django skills by making a project. 

Key features of the app: <br>
    - E-commerce platform (REST API) with backend development using <i>Django Rest Framework</i>.<br>
    - Frontend development using <em>React JS</em>.<br>
    - Implementation of token-based authentication using <em>Djoser</em> and <em>Simple JWT</em>. <br>

You can run the store app locally on your system. You need to follow these steps:

1. Install <em>docker</em> (preferred version 4.22.0) on your system. <br>
2. Clone the repository. <br>
`git clone git@github.com:yogesh-shrestha/django-store-app.git`
3. Change directory. <br>
    `cd django-store-app/api`
4. build docker images and run. <br>
    `docker-compoose up --build` <br>

Development server starts at `http://localhost:8000/`. Fake SMTP Server starts in local server at (`http://localhost:5000/`) which is used for testing email sending tasks during development (https://github.com/rnwood/smtp4dev). If database is not prepopulated with dummy data for some reasons, run `docker-compose run djangoapi python manage.py seed_db`.
